            It was originally taken from a Latin text written by a Roman
            Scholar, Sceptic and Philosopher by the name of Marcus Tullius
            Cicero, who influenced the Latin language greatly.

          <p className="text-sm">
            The filler text we know today has been altered over the years in
            fact. Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
            Accusantium sequi, magnam vitae fugiat similique corporis a commodi
            nesciunt voluptas is not actually a Latin word. It is suggested that
            the reason that the text starts with Lorem is because there was a
            page break spanning the word Do-lorem. If you are looking for a
            translation of the text, it is meaningless. The original text talks
            about the pain and love involved in the pursuit of pleasure or
            something like that.
